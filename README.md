# NNTheSpire
Utilizing a neural network to play the game Slay the Spire

# u/ForgottenArbiter
Big thank you and credit to this user for his following two repos/previous work, they have been a huge help on the setup for communicating the network to the game:

## Communication Mod
Communication Mod is a mod that allows communication between Slay the Spire and an external process. It can be found here:

https://github.com/ForgottenArbiter/CommunicationMod

## spirecomm
The spirecomm package facilitates communicating with Slay the Spire through Communication Mod and accessing the state of the game. It can be found here.

# Progress
Network and parameters currently under tuning and training, aiming for a 30% winrate, will update results here.

# Requirements:

- Python 3.5+

## Running the NN Agent:

To run a simple Slay the Spire NN AI, configure Communication Mod to run main.py

## Installing spirecomm:

Run `python setup.py install` from the distribution root directory
